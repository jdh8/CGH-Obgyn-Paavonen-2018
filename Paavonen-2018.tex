\begin{frame}{Overview}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Vaginal symptoms are remarkably common.
        \item Vaginal infections affect a woman's quality of life by causing
              frustration, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, and vulvovaginal
              discomfort.
        \item An abnormal vaginal microbiome has been linked to adverse
              pregnancy outcomes, pelvic inflammatory disease, an increased
              risk of sexually transmitted infections, and other reproductive
              health problems, such as a poor outcome of in vitro fertilization
              (IVF).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Topics}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This review focuses on bacterial vaginosis and desquamative inflammatory vaginitis.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Both are common, underrecognized disorders, and important new data about them have emerged.
            \end{itemize}
        \item Not discussed are trichomoniasis and vulvovaginal candidiasis.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Vaginal microbiome}
\begin{frame}{Vaginal microbiome}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Natural fluctuations occur during the reproductive cycle and
              throughout a woman's life.
        \item Principally influenced by the effects of estrogen on vaginal
              epithelial cells, the predominance of lactobacilli, and low pH
        \item Transiently influenced by use of antimicrobial agents, sexual
              activity, and menses
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Table 1}

\begin{frame}{Community state types}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Lactobacillus crispatus}, \textit{L. gasseri}, and
              \textit{L. jensenii} usually occur as a single or predominant
              microorganism.
        \item \textit{L. iners} commonly occurs as a component of a
              polymicrobial flora, often transitioning to bacterial vaginosis.
        \item \textit{L. crispatus} excludes other organisms through low pH due
              to robust lactic acid production together with hydrogen peroxide
              and defensins.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Protective mechanisms}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The presence of hydrogen peroxide--producing lactobacilli is
              associated with reduced levels of vaginal proinflammatory
              cytokines.
        \item A low-pH environment markedly inhibits bacterial growth.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Bacterial vaginosis}
\begin{frame}{Bacterial vaginosis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A link between \textit{Gardnerella vaginalis} and abnormal
              vaginal discharge was first described in 1955.
        \item The syndrome was renamed non-specific vaginitis or anaerobic
              vaginosis because anaerobic organisms, in addition to
              \textit{G. vaginalis}, were observed.
        \item Bacterial vaginosis is a polymicrobial disorder of the vaginal
              microbiome that is characterized by the absence of vaginal
              lactobacilli.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Epidemiology}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item One of the most common vaginal ecosystem--related microbiologic
              syndromes among women of childbearing age
        \item Incidence: 7.4 million cases each year in the United States
        \item Prevalence
            \begin{itemize}
                \item 15\% among pregnant women
                \item 20--25\% at student health clinics
                \item 30--40\% at sexually transmitted disease clinics
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ethnic and geographic differences}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The prevalence rates vary strikingly among ethnic groups and countries.
        \item Rates are generally higher in black and Hispanic populations and lower in white and Asian populations.
        \item Reasons are unknown.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis}
    \solo{F1e.jpg}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Characteristics}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A milky, homogeneous, malodorous vaginal discharge that causes
              vulvovaginal discomfort and vulvar irritation
        \item Absence of clinically significant vaginal inflammation as
              indicated by an absence of neutrophils
        \item Fishy smell caused by the release of organic acids or polyamines
              on alkalinization of vaginal fluid, which are by-products of
              anaerobic bacterial metabolism
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The polymicrobial load is increased by a factor of up to
                      1000, as compared with normal flora.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Transmission}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The absence of a clear disease counterpart in males has made it
              difficult to determine whether bacterial vaginosis is sexually
              transmitted.
        \item A systematic review of randomized trials of treatment for male
              sexual partners to prevent recurrent bacterial vaginosis in women
              showed that none of the trials had sufficient power to determine
              the role of the male partner in the recurrence of bacterial
              vaginosis.
        \item Another review concluded that, as compared with placebo,
              antibiotic treatment for the sexual partners of women treated for
              bacterial vaginosis had no effect on rates of clinical or
              symptomatic improvement among the women or on the rate of
              recurrence of bacterial vaginosis for up to 12 weeks after
              treatment.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Similarities to sexually transmitted infections}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item However, bacterial vaginosis and sexually transmitted infections
              have many characteristics in common, and several findings are
              consistent with a strong association between incident bacterial
              vaginosis and sexual activity.
        \item Thus, there may be either unmeasured confounders in these studies
              or a transmissible microbial component of bacterial vaginosis
              that has not yet been identified.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Diagnosis}
\begin{frame}{Diagnosis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gram stain
        \item Wet-mount microscopy for clue cells
        \item pH < 4.7
        \item Quantitative polymerase chain-reaction (PCR)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\againframe{F1a}
\againframe{F1c}

\subsection{Pathogenesis}
\begin{frame}{Pathogenesis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bacterial vaginosis can be considered a biofilm infection, with a
              dense polymicrobial biofilm consisting primarily of
              \textit{G. vaginalis} adhering to the vaginal epithelium.
        \item An \textit{A. vaginae} biofilm is always present with a
              \textit{G. vaginalis} biofilm, and higher bacterial loads
              increase the probability of biofilm formation.
        \item The vaginal biofilm appears to create a favorable anaerobic
              environment for other obligate anaerobic bacteria.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Upper genital tract complications}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Half of women with bacterial vaginosis also have a bacterial
              vaginosis--associated biofilm covering the endometrium.
        \item This may explain the links among adverse pregnancy outcomes,
              pelvic inflammatory disease, and bacterial vaginosis.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Bacterial vaginosis and other sexually transmitted infections}
\begin{frame}{Bacterial vaginosis and HIV}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bacterial vaginosis is associated with not only the acquisition
              but also the transmission of other sexually transmitted
              infections, especially human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
              infection.
        \item In women with bacterial vaginosis, CD4 T cells are recruited to
              the lower genital tract mucosa.
        \item Among HIV-infected women, the quantity of HIV in vaginal
              secretions from women with bacterial vaginosis is increased
              substantially.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bacterial vaginosis and \textit{Chlamydia trachomatis}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{C. trachomatis} infecction is strongly associated with
              bacterial vaginosis.
        \item Chlamydia-associated cervicitis increases the amount of cervical
              secretions. This increase, in turn, may change the vaginal
              ecosystem, favoring the growth of anaerobic microorganisms.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Overall disease burden}
\begin{frame}{Overall disease burden}
    Bacterial vaginosis has a large variety of sequelae in the upper genital
    tract, including
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Increased risks of preterm birth
        \item First-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing IVF
        \item Amniotic-fluid infection
        \item Chorioamnionitis
        \item Endometritis after childbirth or abortion
        \item Infections after hysterectomy
        \item Pelvic inflammatory disease
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Preterm birth}
    Overall, bacterial vaginosis is associated with only a modest increase, by
    a factor of 2, in the risk of preterm birth.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Upper genital tract infection}
    The risks of endometritis after cesarean section, vaginal-cuff cellulitis
    after hysterectomy, and postpartum endometritis are increased by up to a
    factor of 6 among women with bacterial vaginosis.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Screening}
    Several studies have assessed the value of screening for and treating
    bacterial vaginosis in the prevention of preterm birth. The results have
    been highly variable.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Pelvic inflammatory disease}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The link between bacterial vaginosis and pelvic inflammatory
              disease has been more consistently replicated.
        \item Microorganisms that are prevalent in high concentrations in the
              vagina in women with bacterial vaginosis are also observed in the
              endometrium and fallopian tubes in women with proven pelvic
              inflammatory disease.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Treatment}
\begin{frame}{Treatment}
    \solo{T2.eps}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Resistance}
    The presence of \textit{A. vaginae}, which is often resistant to
    metronidazole, predicts a high risk of recurrence, suggesting that
    metronidazole is not an ideal empirical agent.
